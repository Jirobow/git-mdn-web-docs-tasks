    <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

    <p1>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p1>
    <h2>The Llama</h2>
    <p1
      >Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a
      web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.</p1

    <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
    <p1
      >The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly
      by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.</p1
