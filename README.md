## Overview

A look into each and every task I attempted to solve, with my own code. I separated each solution into a different folder for convinience.

## My process

For each task, I started by

1. Copying the expected output into a generic HTML VS Code
2. Putting each element into their respective box (making educated guesses at first)
3. Looking into the provided CSS stylesheet and reassessing (if necessary) my 'guesses' from step 2.
4. Running a live-server to test out after completing step 3, rinse and repeat until my test output looks exactly like expected.
5. Committing and pushing solution into the repository.

### Built with

- VS Code (enhanced with Prettier and Path Intellisense extensions)
- Nodejs (v18.17.1) + live-server node app.

### What I learned

Recaped HTML fundamentals and CSS's basics, mostly gaining confidence.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

My main goal here is to have all of this be second nature moving forward, gaining familiarity with not only HTML, but CSS and even git too, focusing on my future carrer as a fullstack dev.

I'm not comfartable with designing from scratch (an empty styles.css file, for example) yet, but by repeating these and other tasks/challenges this could and will be accomplished.

### Useful resources

- [Git Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE) - Gave me a solid understanding and much more confidence with Git.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - Helped me catch some syntax errors (using .h1 in the stylesheet instead of just h1, for example).
